# Clean Your Data: Introducing OpenRefine Workshop 

Jekyll repo for workshop website

Before analysis comes the messy work of evaluating, cleaning, and transforming data.
This hands on workshop will introduce a free power tool to get the job done: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/index.html). 
We will install Refine, create a project, and get oriented to the many features for exploring and transforming tabular data.
