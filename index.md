# Clean Your Data: Introducing OpenRefine

> Before analysis comes the messy work of evaluating, cleaning, and transforming data. This hands on workshop will introduce a free power tool to get the job done: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/index.html). We will install Refine, create a project, and get oriented to the many features for exploring and transforming tabular data. Intended for: students, faculty, and staff with an interest in cleaning, transforming, and working with diverse data sources. No experience necessary.
